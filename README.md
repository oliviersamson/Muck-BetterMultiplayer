## What's new with this mod

- Chests, Cauldrons and Furnaces are accessible for all players, at the same time.
- Game settings are only modifiable by the lobby host, and all players will be able to see the settings as they are changed in real-time by the host.
- It is possible to return to the same lobby after a game or at any time during the game via the new "Lobby" buttons in the pause menu and the game end menu.
- Returning to lobby with multiple players is available to only the host and will move all players to the lobby after a 3 seconds countdown (cancellable by the host).
- You can now easily invite friends through steam with the new "Invite friend(s)" button in the lobby (inviting friends through the steam overlay was always possible though).
- Dead players will still be visible on the map as a faded player icon.
- Player pings are now visible on the map.
