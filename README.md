# Better Multiplayer

BETA!

Currently adding new functionalities one after the other and refining existing ones.

To report a problem with this mod or for a feature request, please raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/oliviersamson/Muck-BetterMultiplayer/issues "GitHub")

**Note that all players in a lobby need to have this mod installed to play together.**

Currently working functionalities:
- Chests, Cauldrons and Furnaces should be accessible for all players, at the same time.
- Game settings are only modifiable by the lobby host, and all players will be able to see the settings.
- It is possible to return to the same lobby after a game, if the host doesn't quit
- It is also possible to go back to lobby at any time during the game.
- Returning to lobby with multiple players is available to only the host and will move all players to the lobby after a 3 seconds countdown (cancellable by the host)
- You can now invite friends through steam, as an alternative to sharing the lobby id (note that it only works in game as the dev needs to enable launch commands to work without Muck opened)
- Dead players will still be visible on the map as a faded player icon
- Player pings are now visible on the map

TODO:
- Fix "Invite friend(s)" button staying black after click
- Add a way to whitelist the host's mods
- Add a way for the host to cancel going back to the lobby before the 3 seconds countdown is over
