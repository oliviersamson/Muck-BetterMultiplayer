# Better Multiplayer

BETA!

Currently working functionalities:
- Chests, Cauldrons and Furnaces should be accessible for all players, at the same time.
- Game settings are only modifiable by the lobby host, and all players will be able to see the settings.
- It is possible to return to the same lobby after a game, if the host doesn't quit
- You can now invite friends through steam, as an alternative to sharing the lobby id (note that it only works in game as the dev needs to enable launch commands to work without Muck opened)
- Dead players will still be visible on the map as a faded player icon
- Player pings are now visible on the map

TODO:
- Add a "Back to Lobby" button in the pause menu
- Fix "Invite friend(s)" button staying black after click
- Add a way for a player to rejoin the game after a crash/disconnect
- Add a way to whitelist the host's mods
